# NOTE: In a real application, you would load your 'df' DataFrame here.
# For demonstration, we'll create a dummy DataFrame that matches the structure 
# the original code expects (columns 'Faculty' and 'Gender').

data = {
    'Faculty': ['Arts'] * 50 + ['Science'] * 50,
    'Gender': ['Female'] * 30 + ['Male'] * 20 + ['Female'] * 15 + ['Male'] * 35
}

# 1. Data Filtering
arts_df = df[df['Faculty'] == 'Arts'].copy() # Filter for Arts faculty and create a copy

# 2. Count Calculation
gender_counts = arts_df['Gender'].value_counts()

# 3. Matplotlib Figure Generation
# Create the figure object explicitly to pass to st.pyplot()
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 6))

ax.pie(
    gender_counts, 
    labels=gender_counts.index, 
    autopct='%1.1f%%', 
    startangle=90
)

ax.set_title('Distribution of Gender in Arts Faculty')
ax.axis('equal') # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie is drawn as a circle.


# 4. Streamlit Display
